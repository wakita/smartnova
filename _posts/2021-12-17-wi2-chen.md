## Xueyi CHEN Ken WAKITA

**Abstract**: For practitioners working in different fields, reports describing a variety of data facts are authored and analyzed by lots of people every day. To get insights efficiently from such kind of data-rich document, people naturally take notes by using visual marks such as highlights, underlines, circles traditionally. Recently, as business reporting goes electronic gradually, there is a surge of attention and interest in effective support for such kind of report analysis with the power of computer science. In this paper, we design a visual-guided method focusing on business reports exploration, especially, so as to help build visual links among charts and data-facts embedding in the text. The proposed method aims to simplify the authoring of interactive business reports, as well as empower people to comprehend the key information effectively. Several use cases generated by our system based on real business reports are presented to show the usage and capability of the implemented architecture.
