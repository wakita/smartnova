**Abstract**: The purpose of this study is to establish a systematic method of constructing a visual analytics system for adventure travel novels. The system aims to assist in understanding the novel and to encourage communication using this novel as material. For this purpose, we leverage text generation AI, image generation AI, various natural language processing, graph drawing algorithms, optimization, and clustering.
