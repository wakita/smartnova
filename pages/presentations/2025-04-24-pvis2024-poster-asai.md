**Abstract**: When performing dimensionality reduction and visualization of high-dimensional data using PCA, there are cases where one may wish to focus on a specific cluster and investigate its detailed structure and characteristics. In geometric zooming, it is challenging to fully expand the current cluster structure and reveal its internal details. Therefore, a semantic zooming is implemented, which combines data filtering through geometric zooming and recalculation of PCA to update the layout. This method dynamically refines dimensionality reduction based on the distribution of the user-focused local region, enhancing cluster separation. A challenge during this zooming process is that PCA has degrees of freedom with respect to the orientation and rotation of axes, and even a slight zoom can cause significant layout changes, potentially confusing the user. To address this issue, this study applies Procrustes analysis to suppress layout rotation. Additionally, by performing geometric zooming and PCA in multiple stages during the zoom process, the semantic zooming is gradually refined. As an application of this method, its effectiveness is demonstrated using time-series high-dimensional data and dynamic network data.
