**Abstract**: This study aims to visualize massive tree structures and proposes a novel dynamic coloring technique. Conventional static coloring methods for trees attempted to provide a clear visual representation of tree structures, but distinguishing adjacent nodes by color becomes difficult in large-scale trees. This paper addresses this issue by applying dynamic coloring to locally displayed tree portions. By integrating animations that smoothly transition node positions and colors during zoom operations, we reduce the psychological burden associated with recoloring. Our method is applicable to large-scale trees in general. Its effectiveness was demonstrated using a biological classification tree with two million nodes, evaluating execution speed and user experiments.
